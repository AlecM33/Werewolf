# Werewolf
An online multiplayer version of the social deception game Werewolf, and currently a work in progress. 

This is a Javascript application running on a node express server. I am using the socket.io package as a wrapper for Javascript Websocket.

# Run Locally

Run node server.js from the root directory, navigate to localhost:5000
