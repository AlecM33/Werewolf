    <h1 class="how-to-use-header">Purpose of the Application</h1>
    <div class="how-to-use-section">This app serves as a means of running games in a social setting where a traditional
        running of the game is hindered. This might be when people are meeting virtually, and thus roles can't be handed
        out in-person, or when people are in-person but don't have Werewolf cards with them. You can use a deck of regular
        playing cards, but it can be difficult for players to remember which card signifies which role, especially if
        you want to build a crazy game with many different roles. Even when people are together and have cards, there's
        information that would be great to centralize for everyone - a timer, role descriptions, and the in/out status of
        players. This app attempts to provide the utilities necessary to run Werewolf with all the different roles you want,
        wherever you can access the internet.

    <div class="how-to-use-section">
        Creating a game through the app has 3 main components:
        <br>
        <h3>Step One: Choosing method of moderation</h3>
        <br>
        You have two options for moderation during the game. If the moderator isn't playing, you can choose the <span class="emphasized">dedicated
        moderator</span> option. Dedicated Moderators are <span class="emphasized">not dealt into the game</span>. Once they start the game, they will know
        everyone's role. At that point, they can kill players, reveal players' roles to everyone else, transfer their
        moderator powers, play/pause the timer (if there is one), and end the game when team good or evil wins.
        <br><br>
        Similarly, you can also choose the <span class="emphasized">temporary moderator</span> option. The key differences
        here are that you are <span class="emphasized">dealt a role</span>. You have the same powers as the dedicated
        moderator, with the exception of game knowledge - you know the same information that a regular player does.
        When you remove the first player from the game, your powers will be automatically transferred to them - they become
        the dedicated moderator, and you become a regular player.
        <br><br>
        <span class="emphasized">Dedicated moderators</span> can <span class="emphasized">transfer their moderator powers</span>
        to a player that is out, or to a spectator. That way, if the current dedicated moderator has to leave, or simply
        does not want to moderate anymore, they can easily delegate.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        <h3>Step Two: Build your deck</h3>
        <br>
        A default set of common roles are available to you on this page. <span class="emphasized">Available Roles</span>
        are ones that have a widget where you can adjust their quantity and add them to the current game. They have been
        "taken out of the box," so to speak:
        <br><br>
        <img class='tutorial-image-small' src="../images/tutorial/default-roles.PNG"/>
        <br><br>
        You also have a <span class="emphasized">Custom Role Box</span>. These are not yet "available," in that they
        are still "in the box." If you want them in the game, click the green plus button, and they will become part of the
        available roles - a widget will be created, and you can increment or decrement the quantity of that card in the game.
        Custom roles can be created, removed, edited, and imported/exported via a formatted text file:
        <br><br>
        <img class='tutorial-image-small' src="../images/tutorial/custom-roles.PNG"/>
        <br><br>
        Here is this in action. We add the "Clawed Minion" from the Custom Role Box to the Available Roles, and then
        we increment the quantity to 1 and see it has been added to the game:
        <br><br>
        <img class='tutorial-image-small' src="../images/tutorial/add-custom-role.gif"/>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Step Three: Set an optional timer</h3>
        <br>
        If you don't fill in these fields, the game will be untimed. If you do, you can use a time between 1 minute
        and 5 hours. The timer can be played and paused by the current moderator. Importantly, when the timer expires
        <span class="emphasized">nothing automatically happens.</span> The timer will display 0s, but the game will not
        end. Whether or not the game ends immediately after that or continues longer is up to the moderator.
