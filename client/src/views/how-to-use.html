    <h1 class="how-to-use-header" id="purpose-of-the-app">Purpose</h1>
    <div class="how-to-use-section">This app serves as a means of running games in a social setting where a traditional
        running of the game is hindered. This might be when people are meeting virtually, and thus roles can't be handed
        out in-person, or when people are in-person but don't have Werewolf/Mafia cards with them. You can use a deck of regular
        playing cards, but it can be difficult for players to remember which card signifies which role, especially if
        you want to build a crazy game with many different roles. Even when people are together and have cards, there's
        information that would be great to centralize for everyone - a timer, role descriptions, and the in/out status of
        players. This app attempts to provide the utilities necessary to run games with all the different roles you want,
        wherever you can access the internet.
    </div>
    <h1 class="how-to-use-header" id="creating-a-game">Creating a Game</h1>
    <div class="how-to-use-section">
        Creating a game through the app has 3 main components:
        <br>
        <h3>- Step One: Choosing a method of moderation</h3>
        <br>
        You have two options for moderation during the game. If the moderator isn't playing, you can choose the <span class="emphasized">Dedicated
        Moderator</span> option. Dedicated Moderators are not dealt into the game. Once they start the game, they will know
        everyone's role. During the game, they can kill players, reveal players' roles, transfer their
        moderator powers, play/pause the timer (if there is one), end the game (revealing everyone's role), or return the game to the lobby.
        <br><br>
        Similarly, you can also choose the <span class="emphasized">Temporary Moderator</span> option. You are dealt a role,
        and you have the same powers as the Dedicated Moderator, except game knowledge - you know the same
        information that a regular player does. When you remove the first player from the game (which can be yourself),
        they will automatically become the dedicated moderator.
        <br><br>
        <span class="emphasized">Dedicated Moderators</span> can transfer their moderator powers to a player that is out,
        or to a spectator. That way, if the current Dedicated Moderator has to leave, or simply does not want to moderate
        anymore, they can easily delegate.
        <br><br>
        <h3>- Step Two: Build your deck</h3>
        <br>
        There is a role box on this page that includes a list of <span class="emphasized">Default Roles</span> and a list
        of <span class="emphasized">Custom Roles</span>, which can be displayed by selecting the appropriate button within the box.
        If you want to add a certain role to the game, click the <span class="emphasized">green plus</span> and one copy
        of it will be added to the <span class="emphasized">Deck</span> which is the other box displaying a player count.
        Likewise, if you want to remove one copy of a given role, click the <span class="emphasized">red minus</span> on the role
        in the Deck Box.
        <br><br>
        Here I add 3 villagers to the game, and then remove them:
        <br><br>
        <img alt="adding a role to the deck" class='tutorial-image-small' src="../images/tutorial/add-role-to-deck.gif"/>
        <br><br>
        You can add, edit, and remove Custom Roles. You can also import and export them via a formatted text file. Click
        the hamburger menu on the role box to see the import/export options. Here I create a new Custom Role and observe
        it in the list:
        <br><br>
        <img alt="create-custom-role" class='tutorial-image-small' src="../images/tutorial/create-custom-role.gif"/>
        <br><br>
        <h3>- Step Three: Set an optional timer</h3>
        <br>
        If you don't fill in these fields, the game will be untimed. If you do, you can use a time between 1 minute
        and 5 hours. The timer can be played and paused by the current moderator. Importantly, when the timer expires,
        nothing automatically happens. Users will be notified that it has expired, and the timer will display 0s, but
        the game will not end. Moderators always choose to end the game manually.<br><br>
    </div>
    <h1 class="how-to-use-header" id="being-the-moderator">Being the Moderator</h1>
    <div class="how-to-use-section">
        <h3>- In the Lobby</h3>
        <br>
        In the Lobby, moderators can manage the people in the room and the cards in the game. By clicking
        the <span class="emphasized">three vertical dots (AKA the "kebab menu")</span> next to a given player (<span class="emphasized">point A</span>
        in the screenshot below), you have the option to kick that player. You can do the same with a spectator by first
        viewing the spectator list (<span class="emphasized">point C</span>) and clicking their kebab menus. By clicking the
        "Edit Roles" button (<span class="emphasized">point B</span>), you can change which roles are in the game and the
        quantities of those roles. This button will bring up the same module you encountered when you first created the room.
        Saving any changes to the roles may affect the player count. If you wish to <span class="emphasized">start the game (point B)</span>, the number
        of Players in the Lobby must equal the number of cards in the game.
        <br><br>
        <img alt="moderator view in the lobby" class='tutorial-image-small-portrait' src="../images/tutorial/dedicated-mod-lobby-mobile.webp"/>
        <br><br>
        <h3>- During the Game</h3>
        <br>
        <span class="emphasized">Dedicated Moderators</span> can see who is on which team and who is which role. The moderator
        Kills and Reveals players (<span class="emphasized">Point A</span> below). They are separate actions. So, if you
        want to play a game where people's roles are not revealed during the day or night, you can use the "Kill" option
        but not the "Reveal" option. Or, if you happen to have a role that reveals but is not immediately removed from the game,
        you can use the "Reveal" option but not the "Kill" option. You of course don't have to utilize either of these options.
        If you just want to use the app to deal cards, you are free to do that. The moderator also has permission to
        play and pause the Timer (<span class="emphasized">Point B</span>), and can end the game (revealing everyone's role)
        or return the game to the Lobby (<span class="emphasized">Point C</span>), where it can be started anew with different settings.
        <br><br>
        <img alt="moderator view during the game" class='tutorial-image-small-portrait' src="../images/tutorial/dedicated-mod-in-progress-mobile.webp"/>
        <br><br>
        Similarly, the <span class="emphasized">Temporary Moderator view</span> looks like the below image. They have
        much the same abilities as a dedicated moderator, except they don't know role or alignment information and cannot
        transfer their powers. Their powers will be transferred automatically to the first person they remove from the game
        (which can be themselves).
        <br><br>
        <img alt="temporary moderator view during the game" class='tutorial-image-small-portrait' src="../images/tutorial/temp-mod-in-progress-mobile.webp"/>
        <br><br>
        <h3>- Transferring your moderator powers</h3>
        <br>
        You can transfer your moderator abilities to anyone that has been removed from the game, or to anyone that happens
        to be spectating. Here we select a killed player and transfer our powers to them:
        <br><br>
        <img alt="transferring your moderator powers" class='tutorial-image-small-portrait' src="../images/tutorial/mod-transfer.gif"/>
        <br><br>
    </div>
    <h1 class="how-to-use-header" id="being-a-player">Being a Player</h1>
    <div class="how-to-use-section">
        This is an example of what a <span class="emphasized">Player</span> is seeing, including the running timer,
        their role card, and the player list. You can also edit your name for the Room by clicking the pencil next to it.
        Below, we flip our role card up and down by double-clicking it, and then we bring up the prompt to edit our name:
        <br><br>
        <img alt='player-view' class='tutorial-image-small-portrait' src="../images/tutorial/player-view.gif"/>
        <br><br>
        Players can view the timer, but only the current moderator can play and pause it. Your role card starts flipped over
        - this is useful if you are in-person and don't want someone else accidentally seeing your role as
        it is dealt. You can view your role at any time by double-clicking/double-tapping it. Requiring a double-click guards against the possibility
        of accidentally flipping your role when tapping other things. Within the Player List, you can see who is alive or
        dead and who has had their role revealed. There is also a <span class="emphasized">role info button</span> that,
        when pressed, displays all the different roles in the current game, including their descriptions and alignment (Good/Evil).
